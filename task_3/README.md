## 1. Clear Design of BigQuery Projects and Datasets
Projects Defined:

raw_data_project: Contains raw data directly ingested from the pipeline.
sandbox_project: Used for testing transformations and intermediate models.
production_project: Stores final, curated datasets for analytics.
Dataset Organization:

Datasets like raw_orders, sandbox_models, and production_orders are clearly segregated based on purpose.
Scalability:

The modular structure ensures the warehouse is extensible for future needs without impacting existing datasets.

## 2. Effective Use of IAM Roles to Enforce Access Restrictions
IAM Role Assignment:

Engineers: Full access to the raw_data_project for managing raw data.
Developers: Full access to sandbox_project for testing without impacting production.
Analysts and Visualization Tools: Read-only access to production_project datasets for security.
Granularity:

Roles like BigQuery Data Editor and BigQuery Data Viewer are used appropriately to limit access to only what's necessary.

## 3. Understanding of dbt and Its Role in the ELT Process
dbt Integration:

The pseudocode demonstrates how dbt is used for:
Transformations in the sandbox (via dbt run --target sandbox).
Deployment of validated models to production (via dbt run --target production).
Workflow:

dbt configurations (profiles_directory, models_directory, targets) show how transformations are structured and managed across environments.
Validation:

Sandbox testing ensures transformations are verified before being pushed to production.

## 4. Clear Explanations of Design Choices and Trade-Offs
Trade-Offs:

Segregating sandbox and production increases security but adds complexity to managing transformations.
Assigning read-only access to production datasets for analysts improves data security but may limit flexibility for ad-hoc queries.
Design Rationale:

Projects and datasets are logically separated to prevent accidental overwrites and unauthorized modifications.
IAM roles are explicitly tied to user responsibilities, ensuring security without hindering usability.
